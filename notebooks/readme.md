# Jupyter Notebook Files for CoE197M

* Homework 1 - **Positional Encoding**
* Homework 2 - **3-Layer Neural Network on 1D Gaussian**
* Final Project - **STL-10 PCA and GMM Unsupervised Learning (Classification)**


**Notes:** 

* When the final project is downloaded, the notebook will download the needed dataset (about 2-3 Gb) so please take into account the size of the STL-10 Dataset
* When using the Final project, either: (1) include the pca_func.py on your pull and place it on the same directory as the notebook or comment out "import pca_func" on the notebook (This will fix it and the multiprocessing method will not run since it depends on the pca_func.py)
